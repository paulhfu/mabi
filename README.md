Hi
We tried to implement the chambolle paper fist, which did not work. It can be reviewed and executed in mainChambolle.m
Then we implemented the solution in the Beck and Teboulle paper with help of the code you gave us.
You can see the results by running main.m, this uses denoising_isotrop_tv.m.
In test.m we testet the standard, tv-regularization + data-term objective, to compare this to our results.
